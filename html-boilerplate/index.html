        <h3> This is going to be the first paragraph of my first webpage</h3>
        <p> It all may seem silly to you, reader or future me, but <strong>believe me</strong>, it is not </strong></p>
        <!--In this first paragraph I use two essential tags in html: the paragraph tag and the strong tag, that turn the text bold as well as it gives the specific part a greater semantic importance-->
        <p> Humans tend <em>not no pay attention</em> to others experiences nor do they give them the due value </p>
        <!--Here, beside the paragraph tag, I also use the italic tag; it also gives the part a greater meaning, as the bold does.-->
